Husband, expecting father, Marine veteran, former strength coach, cybersecurity professional, hiker, big family, a nerd of endless stories (Marvel, Star Wars, LotR, Harry Potter, ATLA, DBZ, MHA +++)... *how many descriptive terms are enough?* 

Everyday is an adventure. Self-mastery is the ultimate solution to life. Wakanda forever.


**"One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself."** - Leonardo da Vinci
